# Add error tracking

Set up the framework's GLOBAL error boundary so uncaught errors and exceptions
reach PostHog — one handler, not hand-wrapped across files.

Follow the framework's own mechanism for a global error handler, using the
reference example and the docs for the exact pattern. Find the init or app entry,
add the handler there. Do not read through the whole app or wrap individual
components or routes by hand.

If the app already has natural exception boundaries — a server-side API error
handler, a critical flow with its own try/catch — capturing there too is worth a
single edit. The global handler is the floor, not the only place errors matter.
