# Deploy a reverse proxy - Docs

A reverse proxy helps you capture more complete usage data. Ad blockers maintain lists of known analytics domains and block requests to them. A reverse proxy bypasses this by routing events through your own domain, which ad blockers haven't cataloged. This typically increases event capture by 10-30% depending on your user base.

A reverse proxy sends events to PostHog through your own subdomain (like `e.yourdomain.com`) instead of directly to PostHog's domain.

You don't need a reverse proxy to start using PostHog. We recommend setting one up before going to production for more reliable data capture.

## Set up managed reverse proxy

**Third-party processing and HIPAA**

This feature routes traffic through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), which is listed as a [subprocessor](https://posthog.com/subprocessors) in our [Data Processing Agreement](https://posthog.com/dpa). By enabling the managed reverse proxy, data is transmitted to and processed by Cloudflare.

This feature is **not HIPAA-compliant** and should not be used to process Protected Health Information (PHI). Any Business Associate Agreement (BAA) you have with PostHog does not cover this feature.

PostHog's managed reverse proxy routes traffic through our infrastructure. We handle SSL certificates, routing, and maintenance automatically.

This option is free for all PostHog Cloud users. You just need access to your domain's DNS settings.

**Setting up during onboarding?**

If you're onboarding a web-based product like Web Analytics, Surveys, or AI Observability, you'll be guided through managed proxy setup as part of the onboarding flow. The steps below are for setting it up manually from the organization settings.

1.  1

    ## Create your proxy

    1.  Go to [organization proxy settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/organization-proxy)
    2.  Click **new managed proxy**
    3.  Enter a subdomain you control. For example, if your app runs on `myapp.com`, use `yoursubdomain.myapp.com`

    **Before you start**

    Choose a neutral subdomain that doesn't include words like `analytics`, `tracking`, `telemetry`, `posthog`, or `ph`. Ad blockers target these terms. If ad blockers block your domain, the proxy won't achieve its intended effect.

2.  2

    ## Create a DNS record

    Go to your DNS provider and create a new **CNAME record**:

    1.  Set the **Name** to your chosen subdomain (just the subdomain part, like `yoursubdomain`)
    2.  Set the **Target** to the proxy domain PostHog generated in the previous step. You'll see it in your proxy settings, it looks like `4854cf84789d8596ad01.proxy-us.posthog.com`
    3.  Save the record

    **Disable DNS provider proxy features**

    If you're using a DNS provider like Cloudflare that offers proxy options (orange cloud), make sure the proxy is **disabled** (gray cloud) for this CNAME record. Enabling the proxy at your DNS provider may interfere with PostHog's managed reverse proxy functionality and SSL certificate provisioning.

3.  3

    ## Wait for propagation and provisioning

    Your proxy status will change from **waiting** → **issuing** → **live**. This typically takes 2-5 minutes for a new record, but can take up to 30 minutes if DNS propagation is slow. (Propagation can take a few hours if you're making changes to an existing CNAME.)

    PostHog will automatically detect your DNS record and provision an SSL certificate. No further action needed.

    > **Note:** If your proxy stays in **issuing** for more than 30 minutes, see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

4.  4

    ## Update your PostHog SDK

    Update your PostHog initialization to use your new subdomain:

    PostHog AI

    ### US

    ```javascript
    posthog.init("<ph_project_token>", {
      api_host: "https://yoursubdomain.myapp.com",
      ui_host: "https://us.posthog.com",
    });
    ```

    ### EU

    ```javascript
    posthog.init("<ph_project_token>", {
      api_host: "https://yoursubdomain.myapp.com",
      ui_host: "https://eu.posthog.com",
    });
    ```

    Replace `yoursubdomain.myapp.com` with your actual subdomain, and provide your **project token**.

    Always set both `api_host` (your proxy) and `ui_host` (PostHog's actual domain) so features like the toolbar work correctly.

5.  ## Verify your setup

    Checkpoint

    Confirm events are flowing through your proxy:

    1.  Open your browser's developer tools and go to the **Network** tab
    2.  Trigger an event in your app, like a page view
    3.  Look for a request to your proxy subdomain (e.g., `yoursubdomain.myapp.com`)
    4.  Verify the response is `200 OK`
    5.  Check the [PostHog app](https://app.posthog.com) to confirm events appear

    If you see errors or events aren't appearing, see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Troubleshooting

If your proxy is stuck in **issuing** or shows as **erroring**, use the built-in diagnostic tool to identify the issue.

### Run diagnostics

1.  Go to [organization proxy settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/organization-proxy)
2.  Find your proxy in the list
3.  Click the **⋯** menu and select **Diagnose**

The diagnostic runs these checks:

-   **DNS CNAME** – Verifies your CNAME record points to the correct PostHog proxy target
-   **Certificate status** – Checks if SSL certificate provisioning is progressing normally
-   **CAA records** – Scans your DNS tree for CAA records that might block certificate issuance
-   **HTTP-01 challenge** – Tests if the domain verification endpoint is reachable
-   **Live event probe** – Confirms events can flow through the proxy
-   **Certificate expiry** – Warns if an active certificate is expiring soon

Each check shows a status (passed, warning, failed, or skipped) with details and remediation steps when needed.

### Common issues

**CNAME not configured or pointing to the wrong target**

Add or update your CNAME record at your DNS provider. The diagnostic report shows the exact record value you need.

**CAA records blocking certificate issuance**

Your domain has CAA records that don't authorize PostHog's certificate authority. Add CAA records allowing `pki.goog`, `letsencrypt.org`, and `ssl.com` as shown in the diagnostic report.

**HTTP-01 challenge unreachable**

The domain verification URL isn't accessible. Make sure:

-   Port 80 is open and not blocked by a firewall
-   No redirects from HTTP to HTTPS on the verification path
-   No other CDN or proxy is intercepting traffic before it reaches PostHog

**DNS provider proxy enabled**

If you use Cloudflare or a similar DNS provider with proxy features, make sure the proxy is disabled (gray cloud) for your CNAME record.

## FAQ

### Why does my managed proxy stay in "erroring" state with Cloudflare?

If you're using a **Cloudflare Enterprise** zone with **zone hold** enabled, the managed reverse proxy won't work. Zone holds prevent external services from provisioning SSL certificates or verifying DNS for domains in your zone.

You have two options:

1.  **Set up a self-hosted proxy instead:** Use [Cloudflare Workers](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudflare.md) to create your own reverse proxy. This works with zone holds enabled since you're configuring everything within your own Cloudflare account.

2.  **Disable zone hold** (not recommended): Zone holds are typically enabled for security reasons. Disabling them may expose your domain to certain risks. Only consider this if you understand the security implications for your organization.

For most users with Cloudflare Enterprise, option 1 (setting up your own Cloudflare Worker proxy) is the recommended approach.

### For EU Cloud, is managed reverse proxy traffic guaranteed to terminate only at EU Cloudflare edges?

Not strictly guaranteed, but in practice this is usually the case. Cloudflare uses [anycast routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/geographic-traffic-routing/) to terminate connections at the data center closest to the end user, so requests from users in Europe almost always land on EU edges. There are two caveats:

-   If your user is physically outside Europe, their request will terminate at a non-EU edge.
-   If the nearest Cloudflare data center is overloaded or unavailable, traffic may be routed to another region.

We do not enable [Regional Services or the Data Localization Suite](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/) on the managed reverse proxy, so EU-only edge termination is not contractually enforced.

That said, the managed reverse proxy is designed so that **no request content is stored at the edge**, regardless of which data center terminates the connection:

-   The Cloudflare Workers we use to forward traffic to our ingestion pipeline do not log requests.
-   Request caching is not enabled.
-   Cloudflare has confirmed to us that they do not retain request logs for this traffic either.

Once traffic reaches PostHog, it is ingested into the region you selected (EU or US Cloud). If strict EU-only termination at the edge is a hard requirement for your compliance posture, we recommend setting up a [self-hosted proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy.md) on infrastructure you control instead.

### Is the managed reverse proxy HIPAA-compliant?

No. The managed reverse proxy is not HIPAA-compliant and should not be used to process Protected Health Information (PHI). Any Business Associate Agreement (BAA) you have with PostHog does not apply to this feature.

If you need HIPAA compliance, set up a [self-hosted proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy.md) on infrastructure you control instead.

## Deploy your own proxy

If the managed proxy doesn't work for your use case, you can deploy your own reverse proxy.

**Self-hosted proxies**

If you use a self-hosted proxy, PostHog can't help troubleshoot configuration issues.

Proxied traffic – events, session recordings, feature flags, and SDK assets – flows through your provider and counts against their bandwidth and request quotas. On platforms that bill egress or function invocations (Vercel, Netlify, CloudFront, Railway), this can add up for high-traffic sites. The [managed reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy/managed-reverse-proxy.md) avoids these costs entirely.

## FAQ

### Why doesn't PostHog use its own proxy?

We do use our own infrastructure. But ad blockers specifically target well-known analytics domains. When they visit `posthog.com`, they catalog our tracking scripts and add them to block lists.

Your proxy works because ad blockers haven't visited your domain to catalog your setup. They don't know what to block.

### What about DNS uncloaking?

DNS uncloaking (also called CNAME uncloaking) is a technique where a DNS resolver follows the CNAME chain of a subdomain to check whether it ultimately points to a known analytics provider. If it does, the resolver blocks the request before it ever reaches the browser.

This is **only possible at the DNS level** — it requires a custom DNS resolver or network-level tool like NextDNS or Pi-hole. Browser ad blocker extensions (like uBlock Origin) cannot perform DNS lookups. They only see HTTP requests after DNS resolution has already happened, so they rely on static blocklists of known domains and URL patterns.

DNS resolvers with uncloaking support maintain their own lists of known analytics domains. When your subdomain's CNAME chain resolves to one of these domains, the resolver can detect and block it. For the small percentage of users running these DNS configurations, a reverse proxy may not fully bypass blocking.

### Does PostHog provide static IP addresses?

No. Our domains use AWS infrastructure with load balancing, which rotates IPs for performance and reliability.

If your firewall requires IP allowlisting, you have two options:

**Option 1: Use domain-based filtering**

Allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443 to `*.posthog.com`, or allow specific domains: `us.i.posthog.com` and `us-assets.i.posthog.com`. Replace `us` with `eu` for EU region.

**Option 2: Deploy a reverse proxy with a static IP**

This is the recommended approach for enterprise environments with strict firewall policies.

1.  Deploy a reverse proxy in your infrastructure
2.  Assign your proxy a static IP address
3.  Allowlist only your proxy's IP in your firewall

This gives you full control over network routing without depending on PostHog's infrastructure.
