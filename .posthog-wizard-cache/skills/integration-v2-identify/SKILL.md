# Identify users

Identity works differently either side of the network, so work out which side you
are on before you wire anything.

On a client, call the SDK's identify method at the moment the app learns who the
user is — typically on login and signup success. The library remembers it from
there, so identify once rather than per page or per event, and reset on logout so
the next user starts clean.

On a server there is no such moment: one process serves every user at once, so
identity belongs to the request rather than to a login. Bind it once for the whole
request — through the SDK's context API, or the framework middleware where the SDK
ships one — and let the captures inside inherit it. A context around a single
capture buys nothing.

- Use a stable unique id as the distinct id (the user id from your auth), not an
  email or display name — including in server-side calls, where framework docs
  sometimes show an email in the example.
- Prove the id actually reaches the line that identifies, before you rely on it.
  Frameworks routinely withhold the id from the payload the client receives — an
  allow-list on the serialized model, a session callback that returns only name and
  email. Read the shape the code will really see at that point, not the shape of the
  record it came from. Where the id is missing, expose it deliberately at its source;
  never substitute an email, and never pass a value that can be undefined. An
  identify call built from a missing field is rejected by the SDK, and identity then
  silently never happens for anyone.
- Attach useful person properties (email, name, plan).

Find the auth flow first: login and signup handlers, session callbacks. If the
app has no concept of a user, there is nothing to identify — report that and stop.

If the app has both a client and a server, keep them on the same person. Set the
client SDK's `tracing_headers` to the backend's hostname (hostnames only) and it
adds the `X-POSTHOG-DISTINCT-ID` and `X-POSTHOG-SESSION-ID` request headers on its
own — do not hand-roll a fetch wrapper for it. The server reads those headers, but
they are client-controlled: prefer the authenticated user id for anything
security-sensitive.
